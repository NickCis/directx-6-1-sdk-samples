RL Demo

Viewer.exe


The initial scene has a light source in the top right. To see this the view
can be moved backwards and forwards using the T and R keys. Additional objects
can be loaded from the file menu, and new light sources can be added from the
lights menu.  Objects can be rotated with the left mouse button and dragged
with the right.

The last object that was rotated or dragged is the current selection.

The device quality can be altered using the Renderer menu. Using this menu the
type of device used can also be switched from ramp to RGB. When using the RGB
device the color of lights in the scene can be changed in the same way as you
change the color of objects. In 256 color mode it is advisable to dither an
RGB device for best results.
