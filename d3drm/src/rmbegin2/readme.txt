Simple sample that creates a default D3DRM device, loads meshes from
a DirectX files, scales and colors them, sets up a hierarchy of 
frames, adds lights, and rotates the objects. The result is a sun,
planet, and moon scenario, with the moon revolving around the planet,
and the planet revolving around the sun.
