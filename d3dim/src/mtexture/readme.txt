Programming Notes

  This sample shows how to program the multitexture stages using the new 
  IDirect3DDevice3::SetTextureStageState method. Dozens of different effects 
  are attainable with this method. The sample just shows one, monochrome light 
  mapping, which is very popular in current game titles.
