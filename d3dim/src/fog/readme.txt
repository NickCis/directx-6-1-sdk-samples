User's Guide

  Press F1 to see available commands. The effects are most striking in 
  full-screen mode.

Programming Notes
=================
  Games that use terrain typically turn on fog so they can prevent the 
  rendering of objects in the far distance. It looks like a cool effect, but is 
  actually used to get high performance.
