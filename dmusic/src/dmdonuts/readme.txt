User's Guide
============
  Before running the program, make sure that you've set your MIDI control
  panel to your default MIDI device. DirectMusic will use this for hardware
  MIDI. If there is no sound when you run DMDonuts, it was unable to find
  the music subdirectory.

  While the donut floats in space, notice that the music is subtle and spacey.
  Press the arrow keys to move the ship Bounce around and see how the music
  and rhythm respond.

  Shoot the donut by firing with the space bar. Immediately there is an 
  explosion of music and the background music grows in intensity.

  Press the 7 key on the numeric keypad. This turns on the shields. Notice how 
  the music becomes muted as if you were listening from inside the shield.

  When all the donut fragments are destroyed, notice that the music
  immediately transitions into an ending, then starts the next level on the
  start of the next musical theme.

  Notice that the music is never the same.

  You can control the ship with the joystick if you prefer, by changing the 
  input device under the Game menu.

  The following is a complete list of game commands. All numbers must be 
  entered from the numeric keypad. "Joy" refers to a joystick button.

  Key	Command

  

  ESC, F12	Quit

  4	Turn left

  6	Turn right

  5 (Joy 3)	Stop

  8	Accelerate forward

  2	Accelerate backward

  7 (Joy 2)	Shields 

  SPACEBAR (Joy 1)	Fire

  ENTER	Start game

  F1	Toggle trailing afterimage effect on/off

  F5	Toggle frame rate display on/off

  F7	Turn music on/off

  F10	Main menu

  

  The display defaults to 640x480 at 256 colors. You can specify a different 
  resolution and pixel depth on the command line. 

  The game uses the following command line switches, which are case-sensitive:

  e	Use software emulation, not hardware acceleration

  t	Test mode, no input required

  x	Stress mode. Never halt if you can help it

  

  These switches may be followed by three option numbers representing 
  x-resolution, y-resolution, and bits per pixel. For example:
  donuts -t 800 600 16

   

Programming Notes
=================
  Techniques illustrated include the following:
  	Composing and performing style based segments. 

  	Autotransitions on game state changes.

  	Motifs (short musical clips) to highlight actions. Because the motifs
  track the rhythm and harmony of the underlying music, they add to the music
  while providing sonic reinforcement.

  	Dynamic bands that change the orchestration in response to real-time 
  events.
  

  By default, this sample runs on the software synthesizer.  For the best
  sound in Windows 95 and Windows 98, on good wavetable synthesizers that
  follow the GS/DLS1 standards for volume and velocity behavior, recompile
  and undefine the _SOFTWARE_SYNTH_ compile flag. This newly compiled version
  will not run on Windows NT 5.
