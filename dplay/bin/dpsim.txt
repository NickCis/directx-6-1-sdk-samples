DPSIM.DLL and DPSIMCFG.EXE
--------------------------

DPSim.dll is a Simulator Service Provider which provides a test and
simulation environment for DirectPlay applications.  It has two areas
of functionality.  It can simulate low bandwidth or high latency
connections while testing on a high-speed local area network, and it can
generate random or programmed message transmission failures.  The
parameters that control DPSim are set and edited by the Configuration
Manager, DPSimCfg.exe.

The DPSim.dll and DPSimCfg.exe can be found on the DirectX 6.0 SDK
installation in the <mssdk>\samples\multimedia\dplay\bin directory.
The DPSim.dll needs to be copied to the system directory (system32 on NT).

DPSimCfg.exe is used to configure the parameters used by DPSim and to
activate or deactivate it by adding or removing the Simulator Service
Provider registry entry.  When active, it can be selected from the list
of Service Providers.  DPSim is implemented over the TCP/IP Service
Provider.

For more information and a description of the parameters, please refer
to the DirectPlay Tools and Samples section of the DirectX 6.0
Programmer's Reference.
