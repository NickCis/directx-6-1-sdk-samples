Description
===========
  The MouseNon program demonstrates how to initialize and get immediate data 
  from a DirectInput device.

Path
====
  Source: Mssdk\Samples\Multimedia\DInput\Src\MouseNon

  Executable: Mssdk\Samples\Multimedia\DInput\Bin

User's Guide
============
  Move the mouse around and observe how the change in coordinates is displayed. 
  Hold down a mouse button and its number is shown. Note that the cursor 
  doesn't have to be in the application window, but the application does have 
  to be in the foreground.

Programming Notes
=================
  This sample illustrates how an application can use DirectInput to obtain 
  relative mouse data in non-exclusive foreground mode. Approximately 30 times 
  per second the program displays the change in mouse coordinates since the 
  last call to IDirectInputDevice::GetDeviceState.
