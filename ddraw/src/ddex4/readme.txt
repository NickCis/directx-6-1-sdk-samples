  This program requires at least 1.2 MB of video RAM.

Programming Notes
=================
  Unlike DDEx3, the DDEx4 program creates only one off-screen surface. It loads 
  a bitmap containing a series of animation images onto this surface. To create 
  the animation, it blits portions of the off-screen surface to the back 
  surface, then flips the front and back surfaces.

  The blitting routines illustrate the use of a source color key to create a 
  sprite with a transparent background.
