User's Guide
============
  In order to run the program, you must have Windows NT 5.0 or Windows 98 
  configured for multiple monitors.

  The program will run on up to nine monitors. The play area is determined by 
  the monitor configuration of your Windows desktop, which may be adjusted on 
  the Settings tab of the Display Control Panel. The amount of video RAM you 
  have on each video card will determine the maximum resolutions at which you 
  will experience a reasonable frame rate. If the frame rate is slow, try 
  exiting, lowering the resolution or color depth of your windows desktop, and 
  restart.

  Multimonitor Space Donuts supports two command-line switches:

  -w#	Put monitor number # in windowed mode

  -s	Turn sound off

  

  For information on the keyboard interface, see Space Donuts.
