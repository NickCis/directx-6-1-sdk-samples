Programming Notes
=================
  In addition to the front and back surfaces, the program creates two 
  off-screen surfaces and loads bitmaps into them. It calls the 
  IDirectDrawSurface4::BltFast method to copy the contents of an off-screen 
  surface to the back surface, alternating the source surface on each frame. 
  After it blits the bitmap to the back surface, DDEx3 flips the front and back 
  surfaces.
